**Description**: 

This talk presents weather and electric load forecasting using Python data science and machine learning tools (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn). Using weather data from NOAA for the U.S., Florida, and Miami, we  build a data pipeline for data exploration, summarization, visualization, feature engineering, regression and classification, and finally scoring and evaluation of predictive models.
